      <p class="vm-join__faq-answer">Once you become a member, you are granted access to our community chat forum. Each month, our members discuss the different organizations we're interested in and choose one to support. All of the money we've pooled together in our fund is then donated to the organization we select.</p>
      <p class="vm-join__faq-heading">Can I cancel at any time?</p>
      <p class="vm-join__faq-answer">Yes. You can cancel your monthly donation at any time.

      <p class="vm-join__faq-heading">Are my donations tax-deductible?</p>
      <p class="vm-join__faq-answer">Yes. We're working with the Silicon Valley Community Foundation as a donor advised fund, which allows us to simplify the donation process while keeping everything tax-deductible. SVCF uses the billing information you enter through PayPal to mail you the necessary tax documents.</p>
