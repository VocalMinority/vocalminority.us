Thrive connects each family with volunteers who can help and mentor them as they adjust to a new place and culture, local agencies and services that will help them succeed, and a warm community to make them feel at home in their new country.

    short_name: Not In Our Town # On home page
    description: Founded in 1995, Not In Our Town (NIOT) began in Billings, Montana, when a community of working people stood up to a series of hate crimes by white supremacists. After attacks on a Native American woman’s house, an African-American church, and a Jewish family’s home, the entire town refused to be silent and fearful. They stood up to hate with petitions, marches, community outreach, but most importantly — with peace and unity. It worked.
