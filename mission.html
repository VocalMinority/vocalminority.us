      On November 9, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Within a week, the Southern Poverty Law Center had recorded over 700 reports of hateful harassment incidents across the country, up from an average of 5-6 a week. The targets were almost exclusively disenfranchised minority groups: immigrants, people of color, LGBT folk, and Muslims.

    <p class="lead">
      Though we hope that our president-elect will stand for all Americans, his words and actions during the campaign, and the hate that it has enabled, have suggested otherwise. We are deeply concerned that a Trump administration threatens to undo decades of progress in civil rights, civil liberties, and equality of opportunity. He has yet to take office, and a maelstrom of hate groups and hate acts against minorities has already risen. We cannot stand silent. We must stand up to hate. If we cannot rely on our government to protect minorities, then we must all become a part of the minority - the most vocal minority in history.

        We believe that together, we are stronger than the hate that threatens us. We believe that community and sacrifice are the heart of America. We believe that we all stand together, and we must stand with all of those whose rights and wellbeing are being threatened.
