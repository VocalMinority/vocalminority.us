      On November 9, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Within a week, the Southern Poverty Law Center had recorded over 700 reports of hateful harassment incidents across the country, up from an average of 5-6 a week. The targets were almost exclusively disenfranchised minority groups: immigrants, people of color, LGBT folk, and Muslims.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though we hope that our president-elect will stand for all Americans, his words and actions during the campaign, and the hate that it has enabled, have suggested otherwise. We are deeply concerned that a Trump administration threatens to undo decades of progress in civil rights, civil liberties, and equality of opportunity. He has yet to take office, and a maelstrom of hate groups and hate acts against minorities has already risen. We cannot stand silent. We must stand up to hate. If we cannot rely on our government to protect minorities, then we must all become a part of the minority - the most vocal minority in history.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        We believe that together, we are stronger than the hate that threatens us. We believe that community and sacrifice are the heart of America. We believe that we all stand together, and we must stand with all of those whose rights and wellbeing are being threatened.

    <h2>Our Fund and Selection Process</h2>
    <p>
      After Donation Day (the 2nd Tuesday of every month), we will direct our members to donate to the Vocal Minority Fund. The Vocal Minority Fund is a committee-advised fund administered in partnership with Silicon Valley Community Foundation. A committee-advised fund helps us organize all of our donations. Any donation to the fund qualifies for an immediate tax-deduction, and allows us to bundle the donations into monthly grants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each month, we'll be selecting an organization in direct response to rising threats to equity and justice throughout America. We'll solicit nominations from the group, and our founding team will be responsible for ultimately conducting due diligence on each nonprofit and making the final call. Organizations will be vetted on three primary criteria:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Is the organization fighting to protect equity and justice in America?
      </li>
      <li>
        Will a collective donation make an impact on their work?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are they in good financial standing?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Vocal Minority was started by Anne Diaz, Chris Chan, Jake Przespo, Kevin Ball, and Noah Silas. As friends with experience in community organizing and nonprofit fundraising—as well as a deep-seated belief in the need for equity and justice in our society—we were moved by the results of the 2016 election to find a simple but impactful way for people to come together.
