    <p class="lead">
      On November 9, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Within a week, the Southern Poverty Law Center had recorded over 700 reports of hateful harassment incidents across the country, up from an average of 5-6 a week. The targets were almost exclusively disenfranchised minority groups: immigrants, people of color, LGBT folk, and Muslims.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      Though we hope that our president-elect will stand for all Americans, his words and actions during the campaign, and the hate that it has enabled, have suggested otherwise. We are deeply concerned that a Trump administration threatens to undo decades of progress in civil rights, civil liberties, and equality of opportunity. He has yet to take office, and a maelstrom of hate groups and hate acts against minorities has already risen. We cannot stand silent. We must stand up to hate. If we cannot rely on our government to protect minorities, then we must all become a part of the minority - the most vocal minority in history.
    </p>


    <p class="lead">
      <strong>
        We believe that together, we are stronger than the hate that threatens us. We believe that community and sacrifice are the heart of America. We believe that we all stand together, and we must stand with all of those whose rights and wellbeing are being threatened.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Vocal Minority is a community dedicated to fighting for equity and justice in America. We believe a Trump administration poses a distinct threat to countless citizens: immigrants and Black Americans, Muslims and gays, veterans and women. We fight this threat by pooling our money, once a month, to support an organization that is taking a stand to defend our fellow Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a nationwide community of citizens who have chosen to put our money where our mouth is. Each month we choose a single organization that is fighting to protect the disenfranchised. We highlight that organization, the important work that they are doing, and then every member donates. By pooling our resources in this way, each month we are capable of making a substantial impact for an organization.

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>To join Vocal Minority, you must pledge to donate once a month to the nonprofit chosen by the group. Once you make the pledge, you will be granted access to our private announcement list and Facebook Group.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the monthly schedule:</p>
        <p>
          &ndash; <strong>Nominations</strong>: At the beginning of the month, nominations for the month’s nonprofit will be accepted via the Facebook Group.<br />
          &ndash; <strong>Donation Day</strong>: On the 2nd Tuesday of every month, we will announce the month’s nonprofit via email, with a link to donate your pledge amount. We’ll also include a link to confirm that you donated.<br />
          &ndash; <strong>Impact</strong>: On the final day of the month, the impact of our community’s donation will be announced.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first nomination cycle begins on <strong>December 5, 2016</strong>. The first Donation Day will be <strong>December 13, 2016</strong>.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How do you pick the organizations?</h3>
          <p>
            Organizations will be selected in direct response to offenses made by the Trump administration. We’ll solicit nominations from the group, and our founding team will be responsible for ultimately conducting due diligence on each nonprofit and making the final call. Organizations will be vetted on three primary criteria:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Are they fighting to protect equity and justice in America?</li>
            <li>Will a collective donation from our group make an impact on their work?</li>
            <li>Is the organization in good financial standing?</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How will I know the impact of my donation?</h3>
          <p>Our group will forge direct relationships with the nonprofits we give to, and connect our donors to the impact of their dollars through a unique impact report sent at the end of every month. As our membership grows, we expect that the impact from our member donations will result in concrete, positive outcomes that will be communicated to the group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Shouldn’t you focus all of your efforts on one organization?</h3>
          <p>
            Part of our purpose is to shed light on the many organizations that are doing great work to defend the disenfranchised. By highlighting a different nonprofit every month, members will learn about new organizations, and have opportunities to get more involved if they choose.

    <ul class="faq-list">
      <li>
        <h3>What is the suggested donation amount?</h3>
        <p>We've set 3 donation levels:</p>
        <p>
          &ndash; <strong>$27:</strong> In honor of the Bernie Sanders campaign, a campaign by the people, for the people.<br />
          &ndash; <strong>$99:</strong> For the 99%, and those who are able to contribute $99 in the name of equity and justice.<br />
          &ndash; <strong>$538:</strong> Where the electoral college has failed to represent us, we are taking a stand for the underrepresented.<br />
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>How do you verify that a donation has been made?</h3>
        <p>After Donation Day (the 2nd Tuesday of every month), we will send a few reminder emails asking you to confirm via honor system that you donated. While we’re growing, we’ll be using the honor system to verify donations. When our collective giving power reaches $10,000 per month, we will create a donor-advised fund to make it easier to streamline your donations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>How long of a commitment are you asking for?</h3>
        <p>Membership is month-to-month. You can leave at any time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What are some examples of issue areas you intend to support?</h3>
        <p>
          &ndash; Civil Liberties<br />
          &ndash; Disability Rights<br />
          &ndash; Economic Justice<br />
          &ndash; Gay Rights<br />
          &ndash; Immigrant Rights<br />
          &ndash; Media Ethics<br />
          &ndash; Prison Reform<br />
          &ndash; Racial Justice<br />
          &ndash; Veterans’ Rights<br />
          &ndash; Women’s Rights<br />
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Can my donations be anonymous?</h3>
        <p>Yes. However, we ask that you list “Vocal Minority” as the beneficiary when you make your donation so that our community’s total impact can be tracked.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What if I have more questions?</h3>

        <h3>Who is behind Vocal Minority?</h3>
        <p>
          Vocal Minority was started by Anne Diaz, Chris Chan, Jake Przespo, Kevin Ball, and Noah Silas. As friends with experience in community organizing and nonprofit fundraising—as well as a deep-seated belief in the need for equity and justice in our society—we were moved by the results of the 2016 election to find a simple but impactful way for people to come together.
