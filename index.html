      On November 9, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Within a week, the Southern Poverty Law Center had recorded over 700 reports of hateful harassment incidents across the country, up from an average of 5-6 a week. The targets were almost exclusively disenfranchised minority groups: immigrants, people of color, LGBT folk, and Muslims.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      Though we hope that our president-elect will stand for all Americans, his words and actions during the campaign, and the hate that it has enabled, have suggested otherwise. We are deeply concerned that a Trump administration threatens to undo decades of progress in civil rights, civil liberties, and equality of opportunity. He has yet to take office, and a maelstrom of hate groups and hate acts against minorities has already risen. We cannot stand silent. We must stand up to hate.
    </p>


    <p class="lead">
      We believe that together, we are stronger than the hate that threatens us. We believe that community and sacrifice are the heart of America. We believe that we all stand together, and we must stand with all of those whose rights and wellbeing are being threatened.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Vocal Minority is a community dedicated to fighting for equity and justice in America. We believe a Trump administration poses a distinct threat to countless citizens: immigrants and blacks, muslims and gays, veterans and women. We fight this threat by pooling our money, once a month, to support an organization that is taking a stand to defend our fellow Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a nationwide community of citizens who have chosen to put our money where our mouth is. Each month we choose a single organization that is fighting to protect the disenfranchised. We highlight that organization, the important work that they are doing, and then every member donates a minimum of $27. By pooling our resources in this way, each month we are capable of making a substantial impact for an organization.

      <li>
        <strong>How does it work?</strong><br/>
        <p>To join Vocal Minority, you must pledge to donate a minimum of $27 a month to the nonprofit chosen by the group. Once you make the pledge, you will be granted access to our private announcement list and Facebook Group.  <br/>Here is the monthly schedule:</p>
        <p>&mdash; Nominations: At the beginning of the month, nominations for the month’s nonprofit will be accepted via the Facebook Group.
        </p>
        <p>&mdash; Donation Day: On the 2nd Tuesday of every month, we will announce the month’s nonprofit via email, with a link to donate your pledge amount. We’ll also include a link to confirm that you donated.</p>
        <p>&mdash; Impact: On the final day of the month, the impact of our community’s donation will be announced.</p>
        <p> The first cycle begins on December 5, 2016. The first Donation Day will be December 13, 2016.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How will I know the impact of my donation?</strong>
          <p>Our group will forge direct relationships with the nonprofits we give to, and connect our donors to the impact of their dollars through a unique impact report sent at the end of every month. As our membership grows, we expect that the impact from our member donations will result in concrete, positive outcomes that will be communicated to the group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What happens if I miss a month?</strong>
          <p>
            You will have to leave the group. You are welcome to rejoin at any time if you renew your pledge in the next donation cycle.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shouldn’t you focus all of your efforts on one organization?</strong>
          <p>
            Part of our purpose is to shed light on the many organizations that are doing great work to defend the disenfranchised. By highlighting a different nonprofit every month, members will learn about new organizations, and have opportunities to get more involved if they choose.

        <strong>This sounds like Birchbox for Charity.</strong>
        <p>That’s a crude way to put it, but yes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <li>
        <strong>Why is there a minimum of $27?</strong>
        <p>It’s our goal to deliver the highest impact possible to the nonprofits we support. By setting a minimum of $27 (in honor of the Bernie Sanders campaign, a campaign by the people, for the people), we ensure that our members are committed, and that we can maximize our chances of having a disproportionate impact, especially if we’re directing our attention to smaller organizations, or local chapters of larger ones.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How do you verify that a donation has been made?</strong>
        <p>After Donation Day (the 2nd Tuesday of every month), we will send a few reminder emails asking you to confirm via honor system that you donated. While we’re growing, we’ll be using the honor system to verify donations. When our collective giving power reaches $10,000 per month, we will create a donor-advised fund to make it easier to streamline your donations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How long of a commitment are you asking for?</strong>
        <p>Membership is month-to-month. You can leave at any time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What are some examples of issue areas you intend to support?</strong>
        <p>
          &mdash; Civil Liberties</br>
          &mdash; Disability Rights</br>
          &mdash; Economic Justice</br>
          &mdash; Gay Rights</br>
          &mdash; Immigrant Rights</br>
          &mdash; Media Ethics</br>
          &mdash; Prison Reform</br>

          &mdash; Women’s Rights</br>

        <strong>Who is behind Vocal Minority?</strong>
        <p>
          Vocal Minority was started by Anne Diaz, Chris Chan, Jake Przespo, Kevin Ball, and Noah Silas. As friends with experience in community organizing and nonprofit fundraising—as well as a deep-seeded belief in the need for equity and justice in our society—we were moved by the results of the 2016 election to find a simple but impactful way for people to come together.
