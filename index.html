title: Vocal Minority
description: "Vocal Minority is a community dedicated to fighting for equity and justice in America. We believe a Trump administration poses a distinct threat to countless citizens: immigrants and blacks, muslims and gays, veterans and women. We fight this threat by pooling our money, once a month, to support an organization that is taking a stand to defend our fellow Americans."
