    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      Vocal Minority is a community dedicated to fighting for equity and justice in America. We believe a Trump administration poses a distinct threat to countless citizens: immigrants and Black Americans, Muslims and gays, veterans and women. We fight this threat by pooling our money, once a month, to support an organization that is taking a stand to defend our fellow Americans.

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      All members are granted access to our community chat platform (we use Slack). Each month, our members share and discuss the different organizations we’re interested in supporting and choose one. That month’s contribution is then made in the name of The Vocal Minority. By pooling our resources in this way, each month we are capable of making a substantial impact for an organization.
